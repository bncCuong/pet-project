Using redux middleware get api from https://openweathermap.org/api we have 1 weather app with features like hourly forecast(24h), forecast in C or F units, search weather forecast on Around the world.


Working with the API seemed to give me a lot of trouble for the first time but I was able to get over it on my own in the end
